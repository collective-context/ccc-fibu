🎓 Add Developer Handbook - Chapter 1: CASE Tool Fundamentals

BREAKING THROUGH: Document how to derive exact Btrieve structure from MASK files!

New Documentation:
- docs/book-01/README.md (356 lines)
  * Developer Handbook overview and navigation
  * 8 chapters planned, Chapter 1 complete
  * Quick start for new developers and KI agents
  * Learning paths and FAQ

- docs/book-01/chapter-01-case-tool-fundamentals.md (605 lines)
  * Core concept: One MASK file = UI + Database Schema
  * Placeholder syntax explained (^ = CHAR, ` = DOUBLE, etc.)
  * Structure derivation algorithm (step-by-step)
  * Complete FI1310 example with calculations
  * Python code examples for export workflow
  * Quick reference cheatsheet

Key Insight:
  MASK files contain COMPLETE structure information!
  - Placeholder count = Field length (^^^^^^^^ = 8 chars)
  - &DATA directives = Field names
  - Layout order = Record order
  
  NO MORE hexdump guessing! NO MORE reverse engineering!
  Just read the MASK file and you have the schema!

Impact:
- Can now automatically generate parsers from MASK files
- Can export ALL Btrieve files (not just hardcoded ones)
- Can generate React UI from MASK definitions
- Can create REST APIs from MASK schemas
- Complete migration pipeline now possible!

Updated:
- README.md: Added Developer Handbook section

Session Summary:
- docs/2025-11-13/session_2025-01-13_late-evening.md
