feat: Complete UTF-8 conversion and add documentation structure

Extended UTF-8 Conversion:
- Converted 529 additional text files from CP850 to UTF-8
- Extended file types: *.B, *.M, *.TXT, *.PRO, *.LEX, *.HLP, *.DOC, *.INI, *.CFG
- Total conversion: 618 text files (89 + 529)
- Added script: tools/convert_remaining_to_utf8.sh

Documentation Structure:
- Created docs/ directory for development documentation
- Added docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md - comprehensive development history
- Created .logs/ directory for session logs
- Added .logs/session_2025-11-13.md - detailed session log

Validation:
- All converted files verified as readable UTF-8 content
- Binary files (.btr, .exe, .obj) remain unchanged
- Box-drawing characters correctly preserved

The euro_UTF8 directory now contains all text files in UTF-8 encoding,
ready for modern development tools and collaboration.
