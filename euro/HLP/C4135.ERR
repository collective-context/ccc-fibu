  ³
  ³      conversion between different integral types
  ³
  ³      Information was lost between two integral types.
  ³
  ³      For example, the following code causes this warning:
  ³
  ³           int intvar;
  ³           long longvar;
  ³           intvar = longvar;
  ³
  ³      If the information is merely interpreted differently, this warning
  ³      is not given, as in the following example:
  ³
  ³           unsigned uintvar = intvar;
  ³                                     --
