  ³
  ³      could not execute 'component'
  ³
  ³      The CL driver was unable to execute one of the compiler components
  ³      or the linker, possibly for one of the following reasons:
  ³
  ³         þ There is not enough memory to load the component.
  ³
  ³         þ The given component is for the wrong operating system.
  ³
  ³         þ The given component is corrupted.
  ³
  ³         þ An option was specified incorrectly. For example, the
  ³           following command causes this error, as CL tries to
  ³           execute myfile.c:
  ³
  ³                cl /B1 file1.c
