  ³
  ³      assignment within conditional expression
  ³
  ³      The test value in a conditional expression was the result of an
  ³      assignment.
  ³
  ³      This warning is informational.
  ³
  ³      An assignment has a value (the value at the left side of the
  ³      assignment) that can be used legally in another expression,
  ³      including a test expression. However, the intention may have been
  ³      to test a relation instead of an assignment.
  ³
  ³      For example, the following line, which causes this warning,
  ³      assigns b to a and compares the value of a with 0:
  ³
  ³           if (a = b) ...
  ³
  ³      However, the following line tests whether a and b are equal:
  ³
  ³           if (a == b) ...                                                        
  ³                                     --
