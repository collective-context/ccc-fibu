  ³      Multiple code segments in module of overlaid program incompatible
  ³      with /CODEVIEW
  ³
  ³      When debugging with CodeView, if there are multiple code segments
  ³      defined in one module (.OBJ file) by use of the compiler #pragma
  ³      alloc_text() and the program is built as an overlaid program, you
  ³      can access the symbolic information for only the first code
  ³      segment in overlay. Symbolic information for the rest of the code
  ³      segments in overlay is not accessible.
