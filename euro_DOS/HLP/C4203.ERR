  ³
  ³      'function' : function too large for global optimizations
  ³
  ³      The named function was too large to fit in memory and be compiled
  ³      with the selected optimization. The compiler did not perform any
  ³      global optimizations (/Oe, /Og, or /Ol). Other /O optimizations,
  ³      such as /Oa and /Oi, are still performed.
  ³
  ³      One of the following may remove this warning:
  ³
  ³         þ Recompile with fewer optimizations.
  ³
  ³         þ Divide the function into two or more smaller functions.
  ³
  ³         þ In OS/2, recompile using the /B2 C2L option to invoke the
  ³           large-model version of the second pass of the compiler.
  ³                                     --
