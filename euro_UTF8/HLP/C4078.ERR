  ³
  ³      case constant 'value' too big for the type of switch expression
  ³
  ³      A value appearing in a case statement was larger than the size of
  ³      the type in the switch expression. The compiler converted the case
  ³      value to the type of the switch expression.
  ³
  ³      A problem can occur when two case constants have different values
  ³      before being cast but the same value afterward.
