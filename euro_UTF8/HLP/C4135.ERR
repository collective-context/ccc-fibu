
  │      Compiler warning (level 4) C4135
  │
  │      conversion between different integral types
  │
  │      Information was lost between two integral types.
  │
  │      For example, the following code causes this warning:
  │
  │           int intvar;
  │           long longvar;
  │           intvar = longvar;
  │
  │      If the information is merely interpreted differently, this warning
  │      is not given, as in the following example:
  │
  │           unsigned uintvar = intvar;
  │                                     --
