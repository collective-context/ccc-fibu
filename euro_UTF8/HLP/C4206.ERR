  │
  │      assignment within conditional expression
  │
  │      The test value in a conditional expression was the result of an
  │      assignment.
  │
  │      This warning is informational.
  │
  │      An assignment has a value (the value at the left side of the
  │      assignment) that can be used legally in another expression,
  │      including a test expression. However, the intention may have been
  │      to test a relation instead of an assignment.
  │
  │      For example, the following line, which causes this warning,
  │      assigns b to a and compares the value of a with 0:
  │
  │           if (a = b) ...
  │
  │      However, the following line tests whether a and b are equal:
  │
  │           if (a == b) ...
