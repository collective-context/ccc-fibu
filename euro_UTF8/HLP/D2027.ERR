
  │      Command-line error D2027
  │
  │      could not execute 'component'
  │
  │      The CL driver was unable to execute one of the compiler components
  │      or the linker, possibly for one of the following reasons:
  │
  │         ■ There is not enough memory to load the component.
  │
  │         ■ The given component is for the wrong operating system.
  │
  │         ■ The given component is corrupted.
  │
  │         ■ An option was specified incorrectly. For example, the
  │           following command causes this error, as CL tries to
  │           execute myfile.c:
  │
  │                cl /B1 file1.c
